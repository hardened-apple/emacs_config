* Next:
        Make a note of all the keybindings I've set up.

* Check:
       Are slime and paredit shadowing each other a lot?
       Why is ace-jump-mode giving errors with character option?
       How does elscreen compare to winring and escreen?

* Configuration File:
       Check if I should combine some _conf.el files.

* Extras I want:
       Saving session on disk.
              http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SessionManagement
       Jump directly to info file when name saved.
            i.e. have  "(elisp) Command Loop" in a buffer, how to jump directly
            to it
       Completion with small pop-up of options (i.e. like vim)
       Shortcut to switch to magit in current window.
       Tabs that I can associate buffers to.
            see http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElscreenSeparateBufferLists
       Different theme on terminal to window systems - remember server mode.
       Different options depending on filetype (e.g. 125 char wide tex buffers)
       Open multiple help files at the same time.

* Things to learn:
       Winner mode - find out it's capabilities
       VC mode     - try it out on my work mercurial repo
       Org mode    - redo this file

* Plugins
** Plugins to check out:
       cedet                 - bunch of coding tools
       ecb                   - emacs code browser
       elisp-slime-nav-mode  - M-. and M-, for elisp
       flymake               - syntax checking
       imenu                 - list functions in buffer (programmable)
       ido-imenu             - find symbols in buffer and jump to.
       iy-go-to-char         - basically f,F,t,T for emacs.

       python packagas
              elpy
              jedi

** Plugins to get / understand:
       helm              - fuzzy file finder and more.
       el-get            - an "extra" package manager for emacs packages.
       smex.el           - ido like M-x
       Org-mode


** Plugins to look for:
       folding          - Need this quite badly.


* Evil mode:
** Next
        Fix evil-elscreen
            At the moment gt and gT don't cycle
            This is because the function .../tab-next gets the count 1 when
                 simply pressing gt, and acts like "go to tab 1"

** Map paredit mappings into evil normal mode.
       Though not sure it's possible with the <( and >) mappings
        i.e.
            W   - Move sexp
            B   - Move sexp
            gE  - Move sexp
            E   - Move sexp
            w   - Move WORD
            b   - Move WORD
            e   - Move WORD
            ge  - Move WORD

** Porting my vimrc
          Visual mode indentation keeping the visual selection.
          Port unimpaired (or at least the part I use often)
          Get submodes (like submode.vim)
             evil-define-state
             (info "(evil) States")

** Keys that I feel comfortable replacing in evil, not going to in vim:
              Q
              gQ
              spelling commands.

** Things not in evil that are in vim:
       C-x C-(anything not linewise)
       [I, ]I, [D, ]D, [d, ]d, [i, ]i
       gp, gP

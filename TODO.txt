* Next:
        Make a note of all the keybindings I've set up.
        Learn Org mode      - Use it to reorganise this file


* Configuration file:
       Get slime to work with the normal packaging system.
       Check that slime and paredit aren't shadowing each other too much.
       Method of switching to magit in the current buffer
       Make the check for if is an X frame or in the terminal allow for emacs
            being run as a daemon.
            Define a function that looks at the frame, if it's in a terminal
                   then it removes any theme that's active
                   otherwise it makes sure a theme is active (and that there is
                   not more than one theme active)
            Functions that might be useful:
                  server-create-tty-frame, server-create-window-system-frame, server-handle-delete-frame
                  before-make-frame-hook, after-make-frame-functions, after-init-hook

* Things to add to emacs:
       Open multiple help files at the same time.
            Some method of saying "follow this help link in a separate buffer"
            This would then rename the current buffer as "*Help1*" and then
                follow the link opening the "*Help*" buffer as usual.
       Autocompletion method - show possible options
                               add option to only complete longest shared text

* Slime/paredit rebindings:
      In emacs mode, find some different bindings (C-M-<key> is a bit of a pain).
      In evil mode, swap word and WORD motions, then swap WORD and sexp motions.

* Things to figure out:
       VC   - Version control interface for emacs.
              Is a general version, so doesn't have all the git abilities, but
              still worth learning.

* Plugins
** Plugins to check out:
       cedet                 - bunch of coding tools
       ecb                   - emacs code browser
       elisp-slime-nav-mode  - M-. and M-, for elisp
       flymake               - syntax checking
       imenu                 - list functions in buffer (programmable)
       ido-imenu             - find symbols in buffer and jump to.
       iy-go-to-char         - basically f,F,t,T for emacs.

       python packagas
              elpy
              jedi

** Plugins to get / understand:
       helm              - fuzzy file finder and more.
       el-get            - an "extra" package manager for emacs packages.
       smex.el           - ido like M-x
       Org-mode


** Plugins to look for:
       folding          - Need this quite badly.


* Evil mode:
** Next
        Fix evil-elscreen

** Map paredit mappings into evil normal mode.
       Though not sure it's possible with the <( and >) mappings
        i.e.
            W   - Move sexp
            B   - Move sexp
            gE  - Move sexp
            E   - Move sexp
            w   - Move WORD
            b   - Move WORD
            e   - Move WORD
            ge  - Move WORD

** Porting my vimrc
          Visual mode indentation keeping the visual selection.
          Port unimpaired (or at least the part I use often)
          Get submodes (like submode.vim)
             evil-define-state
             (info "(evil) States")

** Keys that I feel comfortable replacing in evil, not going to in vim:
              Q
              gQ
              spelling commands.

** Things not in evil that are in vim:
       C-x C-(anything not linewise)
       [I, ]I, [D, ]D, [d, ]d, [i, ]i
       gp, gP

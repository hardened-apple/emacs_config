Configuration file:
       Get slime to work with the normal packaging system.
       Check that slime and paredit aren't shadowing each other too much.
       If loading emacs in terminal, disable colour scheme.

Things to add to emacs:
       Open multiple help files at the same time.
       Easier remove/move/copy/mkdir commands (without having to go into dired)
       Autocompletion method - show possible options
                               add option to only complete longest shared text
       Add "git submodule foreach git pull" to the Magit submodule buffer

Slime/paredit rebindings:
      In emacs mode, find some different bindings (C-M-<key> is a bit of a pain).
      In evil mode, swap word and WORD motions, then swap WORD and sexp motions.

Things to figure out:
       VC   - Version control interface for emacs.
              Is a general version, so doesn't have all the git abilities, but
              still worth learning.


Plugins to get / understand:
       el-get            - an "extra" package manager for emacs packages.
       Elscreen.el       - Maybe tabs for emacs.
       smex.el           - ido like M-x
       Org-mode


Plugins to look for:
       folding          - Need this quite badly.


Evil mode:
       Visual mode indentation keeping the visual selection.
       I want submodes - like Submode.vim

       Map paredit mappings into evil normal mode.
       Though not sure it's possible with the <( and >) mappings
        i.e.
            W   - Move sexp
            B   - Move sexp
            gE  - Move sexp
            E   - Move sexp
            w   - Move WORD
            b   - Move WORD
            e   - Move WORD
            ge  - Move WORD

       Keys that are valid mappings (i.e. don't directly overwrite anything):
           z .. {p,q,u,y,B,I,J,K,P,Q,S,T,U,V,Y,Z}
           Z .. [^ZQ]
           [ .. something
           ] .. something
           c .. something
           d .. something
           y .. something
           g .. something
           \ .. something

          Keys that I feel comfortable replacing in evil, not going to in vim:
              Q
              gQ
              spelling commands.

       Plugins to replace:
            Unimpaired

Things not in evil:
       C-x C-(anything not linewise)
       [I, ]I, [D, ]D, [d, ]d, [i, ]i
       gp, gP

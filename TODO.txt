Configuration file:
       Get slime to work with the normal packaging system.
       Check that slime and paredit aren't shadowing each other too much.
       Make the check for if is an X frame or in the terminal allow for emacs
            being run as a daemon.
            Define a function that looks at the frame, if it's in a terminal
                   then it removes any theme that's active
                   otherwise it makes sure a theme is active (and that there is
                   not more than one theme active)
            Functions that might be useful:
                  server-create-tty-frame, server-create-window-system-frame, server-handle-delete-frame
                  before-make-frame-hook, after-make-frame-functions, after-init-hook

Things to add to emacs:
       Open multiple help files at the same time.
            Some method of saying "follow this help link in a separate buffer"
            This would then rename the current buffer as "*Help1*" and then
                follow the link opening the "*Help*" buffer as usual.
       Easier remove/move/copy/mkdir commands (without having to go into dired)
       Autocompletion method - show possible options
                               add option to only complete longest shared text
       Add "git submodule foreach git pull" to the Magit submodule buffer

Slime/paredit rebindings:
      In emacs mode, find some different bindings (C-M-<key> is a bit of a pain).
      In evil mode, swap word and WORD motions, then swap WORD and sexp motions.

Things to figure out:
       VC   - Version control interface for emacs.
              Is a general version, so doesn't have all the git abilities, but
              still worth learning.

Plugins to investigate:
       ecb               - emacs code browser
       cedet             - bunch of coding tools
       flymake           - syntax checking
       imenu             - list functions in buffer (programmable)
       iy-go-to-char     - basically f,F,t,T for emacs.
       ace-jump          - similar to easy-motion
       expand-region     - select whatever "thing" you're in at the moment
                            (be it word, string, function, class ...)
       python packagas
              elpy
              jedi

Plugins to get / understand:
       helm              - fuzzy file finder and more.
       el-get            - an "extra" package manager for emacs packages.
       Elscreen.el       - Maybe tabs for emacs.
       smex.el           - ido like M-x
       Org-mode


Plugins to look for:
       folding          - Need this quite badly.


Evil mode:
       Visual mode indentation keeping the visual selection.
       I want submodes - like Submode.vim

       Map paredit mappings into evil normal mode.
       Though not sure it's possible with the <( and >) mappings
        i.e.
            W   - Move sexp
            B   - Move sexp
            gE  - Move sexp
            E   - Move sexp
            w   - Move WORD
            b   - Move WORD
            e   - Move WORD
            ge  - Move WORD

       Keys that are valid mappings (i.e. don't directly overwrite anything):
           z .. {p,q,u,y,B,I,J,K,P,Q,S,T,U,V,Y,Z}
           Z .. [^ZQ]
           [ .. something
           ] .. something
           c .. something
           d .. something
           y .. something
           g .. something
           \ .. something

          Keys that I feel comfortable replacing in evil, not going to in vim:
              Q
              gQ
              spelling commands.

       Plugins to replace:
            Unimpaired

Things not in evil:
       C-x C-(anything not linewise)
       [I, ]I, [D, ]D, [d, ]d, [i, ]i
       gp, gP

* Next:
        Make a note of all the keybindings I've set up.

* Check:
       Are slime and paredit shadowing each other a lot?
       How does elscreen compare to winring and escreen?

* Extras I want:
       Tabs that I can associate buffers to.
            see http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElscreenSeparateBufferLists
       Grep all files in a fileset nicely (into *grep* buffer)
       GrepAdd equivalent.
       Make each namesession create a temporary fileset so I can run commands on it
       Evil surround - deleting surroundings removes everything inside and to
              the left of the cursor with it.
       Shortcut to switch to magit in current window.
                temporarily set same-window-regexps?
       Completion with small pop-up of options (i.e. like vim)
       Different theme on terminal to window systems - remember server mode.
       Open multiple help files at the same time.

* Things to learn:
       How to set prefix keys, especially in evil.
       Winner mode            - find out it's capabilities
       VC mode                - try it out on my work mercurial repo
       Org mode               - redo this file
       Buffer menu does more  - (emacs) Several Buffers

** Plugins to look for:
       folding          - Need this quite badly.


* Evil mode:
** Next
        Fix evil-elscreen
            At the moment gt and gT don't cycle
            This is because the function .../tab-next gets the count 1 when
                 simply pressing gt, and acts like "go to tab 1"

** Map paredit mappings into evil normal mode.
       Though not sure it's possible with the <( and >) mappings
        i.e.
            W   - Move sexp
            B   - Move sexp
            gE  - Move sexp
            E   - Move sexp
            w   - Move WORD
            b   - Move WORD
            e   - Move WORD
            ge  - Move WORD

** Porting my vimrc
          Visual mode indentation keeping the visual selection.
          Port unimpaired (or at least the part I use often)
          Get submodes (like submode.vim)
             evil-define-state
             (info "(evil) States")

** Keys that I feel comfortable replacing in evil, not going to in vim:
              Q
              gQ
              spelling commands.

** Things not in evil that are in vim:
       C-x C-(anything not linewise)
       [I, ]I, [D, ]D, [d, ]d, [i, ]i
       gp, gP
